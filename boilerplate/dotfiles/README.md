Dotfiles go here as examples. Files must include the `.example` suffix to avoid accidental installation.

Example files included:
- `.gitconfig.example` — git config you can copy or symlink
- `.zshrc.example` — small zshrc example showing prompt and common aliases

Installation

Use the top-level `boilerplate/scripts/setup.sh` script which will prompt before creating or overwriting files.
